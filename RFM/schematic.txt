#### RFM pipeline dev notebook

Rscript-
To start it would be nice to have an Rscript that took an object as input, and output matrices and metadata for the groups of interest. 

A matrix & metadata created with no group info would contain all cell barcodes, with metadata for all catagories of condition or whatever metadata feature
we would be attempting to distinguish.

If there is split.by group info, matrices and metadata would be created for each of these groups independently.  

Similary there will be comparison input. Like the DE-pipeline it can point to a text file of desired comparisons.
If no file is presented all catagories will be present in the matrix/metadata representing that group. 
Otherwise a matrix & metadata will be created for each comparison in the specified group.

Example:
hepatocye/nash_nash.regression
hepatocyte/nash_nash.control
endothelial/nash_nash.regression
endothelial/nash_nash.control

Python-
Then using python and RFM a script could be pointed to the directory containing the matrices and metadata,
and create output for each group. Output might contain tables, plots, model diagnostics, ect...
